# R-Studio-Data-Manipulation-and-Analysis
Welcome to the R-Studio Data Manipulation and Analysis repository! This collection of projects originated from University of Pretoria course module STC 122 and explores inferential concepts, experimental and observational data analysis, and measures of association using the power of R-Studio.

Key Features:

Inferential Concepts: Delve into the world of inferential statistics, exploring the principles of statistical inference, uncertainty, and goodness of fit.

Data Manipulation: Gain hands-on experience in manipulating raw data, transforming it into valuable insights through practical coding and simulation within a data science framework.

Statistical Measures: Learn about statistical measures of association and accuracy, equipping you with the tools to make informed data-driven decisions.

Linear Regression: Get introduced to linear regression and discover how to reduce variation through regression analysis. Explore conditional distributions of residuals and their significance.

Simulation-Based Inference: Understand the power of simulation-based inference, including concepts like conditional means and prediction intervals, enabling you to draw meaningful conclusions from your data.

Data Visualization: Master bivariate data visualization techniques to effectively communicate your findings and insights.

Supporting Mathematical Concepts: Enhance your understanding of supporting mathematical concepts that underpin statistical analysis.

By exploring this repository, you will:

Develop practical coding skills in R-Studio for data manipulation and analysis.
Gain a deep understanding of statistical concepts and their real-world applications.
Be equipped to interpret and visualize data effectively.
Acquire knowledge that is valuable for both academic pursuits and practical data science projects.
